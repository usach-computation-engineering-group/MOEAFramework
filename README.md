The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, Îµ-MOEA, GDE3, PAES, PESA2, SPEA2, IBEA, SMS-EMOA, SMPSO, OMOPSO, CMA-ES, and MOEA/D. In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization algorithms.

Its key features includes:

Fast, reliable implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms
Extensible with custom algorithms, problems and operators
Supports master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization
Tools for building and statistically testing new optimization algorithms
Professional support for businesses
Permissive open source license
Fully documented and tested source code
Since its initial release in 2011, the MOEA Framework has been downloaded over 38,000 times, averaging over 900 downloads per month this past year. Please contact us if you are interested in contributing!
